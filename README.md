# fusion-rest-py

A wrapper for the VMware Fusion REST API


## Capabilities

### Virtual Machines

* CRUD
* Power on/off

### Network Adapters
* CRUD


## Limitations

MAC or IP addresses are autogenerated and read-only via API. Renders the API largely useless for my needs (cannot assign an IP if I cannot set the MAC addr; too much manual intervention).
